    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>Here's some of the series' main characters.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Tanjiro Kamado</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Tanjiro is kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes. He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve; the best example of this being his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Nezuko Kamado</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Nezuko's original personality as a human was that of a kind and caring girl who thought of others before herself much like her older brother, Tanjiro. Additionally, she was a responsible elder sister to her younger siblings and often put their needs first rather than her own. Nezuko is, however, not afraid to get in harm's way, protecting her friends from Demons even after being returned to a human state.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Zenitsu Agatsuma</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Zenitsu comes off as a coward, as he often claims that he doesn't have long to live due to the dangerous job of being a Demon Slayer. He also has rather low self-esteem despite his strength, even considering himself useless as seen when he couldn't believe he had slain a Demon and tricked himself into instead believing that it was Shoichi, even though the latter was a young child who didn't possess any form of special Demon-slaying ability.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Inosuke Hashibira</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Inosuke is an extremely short-tempered and proud young man who always likes to think he is the strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting others to respect and praise him for his skill.</p>

    <h2>Demons</h2>
    <p>Demons are supernatural beings that feed on humans. They avoid sunlight and the only way to kill them is by cutting their heads off. With supernaturally enhanced limbs, they can regenerate quickly. The more blood they have, the stronger they are. There are a group of high-ranking demons known as the Twelve Kizuki who have Japanese numbers engraved in their eyes.</p>

    <h3>Kyojuro Rengoku</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Kyojuro is greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He is amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He is an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age—the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Akaza</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Akaza is a strong, stubborn and impulsive Demon who enjoyed fighting, especially strong Demon Slayers. He looked down on anybody he deemed weak, but genuinely respected those who were strong in his eyes, regardless of their race. Once he met someone he deems strong, he demanded to know their name, and would not stop until he finds out; he remembers all the names he's committed to memory as tribute to their strength.</p>
