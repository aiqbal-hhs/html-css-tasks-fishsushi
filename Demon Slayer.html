    <h2>Demons</h2>
    <p>Demons are supernatural beings that feed on humans. They avoid sunlight and the only way to kill them is by cutting their heads off. With supernaturally enhanced limbs, they can regenerate quickly. The more blood they have, the stronger they are. There are a group of high-ranking demons known as the Twelve Kizuki who have Japanese numbers engraved in their eyes.</p>
