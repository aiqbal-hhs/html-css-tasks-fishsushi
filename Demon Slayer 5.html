    <p>Demon Slayer is a manga/anime series that can be broken down into eleven arcs, these include:</p>
        
        <h2>Final Selection Arc</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Final Selection is an entrance exam for individuals who seek to become a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps. The exam takes place on Fujikasane Mountain, where Wisteria flowers bloom every season from the mountain's foot to its slope. The area around the mountaintop does not have any Wisteria flowers and is infested with Demons, which were caught alive and placed on the mountain by existing Demon Slayers. Since Wisteria is poisonous to Demons, the Demons remain trapped on the mountain top and cannot leave.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The exam requires the examinee to survive seven nights on the mountaintop, without any outside aid. Candidates who successfully survive the seven nights are then permitted to become official members of the Demon Slayer Corps. At the end of the exam, they get to choose their own ore for their Nichirin Blade and, additionally, receive their own uniform and Kasugaigarasu.</p>

        <br>
        <p>To escape the situation, Muzan transforms a man into a Demon and flees with his family as Tanjiro deals with the new demon.

Yushiro is a demon as well, and they're trying to eliminate Muzan.</p>

        <br>
        <p>In order to delay Muzan's regeneration, he made the explosion deadlier by adding spike traps and while Muzan was busy trying to heal himself, he was again attacked and immobilized by a Blood Demon Art which summoned spikes in the area. Due to the spikes piercing his flesh, Muzan tried to absorb them to escape but out of nowhere, Tamayo appears and stabs Muzan with a special medicine she had concocted. However, Muzan absorbs her entire arm as she does so.</p>

Realizing that they are in the middle of the city Tanjiro panics and Kiriya Ubuyashiki sweats and says that they were all flung much further than he had expected they would be. He asks his sister how long it is until dawn and she informs him that there is still an hour and a half left until daybreak as Kiriya's eyes widen at the knowledge that there is still so much longer left.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A crow tells the Demon Slayers how much longer they have left till dawn and taking note of the fact, Tanjiro looks around to confirm that his comrades are doing alright. Relieved that the Hashira who had been with him are all safe, Tanjiro moves out to try and sniff Muzan out. Suddenly the Demon Lord bursts through a pile of rubble, sending it flying in all directions. Enraged, Muzan taunts the Demon Slayers and dares them to keep him there until dawn if they could even do so.</p>
