<h2>About</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Demons come in a variety of forms. Most look human at first, only with slight changes, such as paler skin, catlike eyes with unusually-colored sclera, dark markings that come in various patterns across their bodies, and/or a change in hair color. The changes differ from Demon to Demon, as some Demons can still retain their normal appearance while others gain monstrous features like multiple heads, mouths, or limbs. Sunlight is deadly to them and will burn them to ash, so they strictly operate at night. Demons have an abnormally powerful physical constitution and regenerative ability which makes them immune to normal weaponry and grants them the ability to regenerate from most wounds with ease. Only the Nichirin Blades, special weapons made from special ore with sunlight absorption properties, allowing then to inflict life-threatening wounds on Demon kind. Of course, even with a Nichirin Blade, the only method guaranteed to kill a Demon is by chopping their head off. They are also known to hate Wisteria flowers which are poisonous to them and whose smell is repudiated by them.</p>

    <h3>Ranks</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The Twelve Kizuki are the 12 strongest beings amongst Demon-kind, second in strength and authority only to the Demon King himself, Muzan Kibutsuji. Each member of the Twelve Kizuki has received a larger portion of Kibutsuji's blood than other Demons, greatly augmenting their powers. The Twelve Kizuki are divided into two groups, the six Upper Ranks, numbered one through six, and the six Lower Ranks, also numbered one through six. The number signifies their ranking among the Kizuki, determined by each member's level of strength, Upper Rank 1 being the strongest and Lower Rank 6 being the weakest. The Lower Ranks have their numbers and ranks engraved only into one eye, whereas the Upper Ranks have their numbers in one eye and the kanji for "Upper Rank" in the other.</p>

    <h3>Are They All Bad?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>No. Though there's not many, some demons are actually good. An example is Nezuko, Tanjiro's sister. She defends humans and fights alongside Tanjiro and the others against other demons. Instead of having to feed on humans, she sleeps in order to recover her energy. Other good demons are very similar to Nezuko, but they still require blood. Instead of killing people, they drink a tiny bit of blood from people who allow them, and not enough to harm them.</p>
