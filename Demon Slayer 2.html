    <br>
    <p>Here's some of the series' main characters.</p>
    <br>
    
    
    <h3>Tanjiro Kamado</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Tanjiro is kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes. He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve; the best example of this being his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister.</p>

    <br>
    
    
    <h3>Nezuko Kamado</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Nezuko's original personality as a human was that of a kind and caring girl who thought of others before herself much like her older brother, Tanjiro. Additionally, she was a responsible elder sister to her younger siblings and often put their needs first rather than her own. Nezuko is, however, not afraid to get in harm's way, protecting her friends from Demons even after being returned to a human state.</p>

    <br>
    
    
    <h3>Zenitsu Agatsuma</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Zenitsu comes off as a coward, as he often claims that he doesn't have long to live due to the dangerous job of being a Demon Slayer. He also has rather low self-esteem despite his strength, even considering himself useless as seen when he couldn't believe he had slain a Demon and tricked himself into instead believing that it was Shoichi, even though the latter was a young child who didn't possess any form of special Demon-slaying ability.</p>

    <br>
    
    
    <h3>Inosuke Hashibira</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Inosuke is an extremely short-tempered and proud young man who always likes to think he is the strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting others to respect and praise him for his skill.</p>

    <br>
    
    
     <h3>Genya Shinazugawa</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Genya is a foul-mouthed and ill-tempered individual; a "lone wolf" who refused any help from others and did not show any interest in being polite or having any manners. During the Final Selection, he roughly handled Kanata Ubuyashiki by grabbing her hair and yelling at her despite her being a child. His ill temper and brash way of speaking heavily resembles that of his older brother, Sanemi.</p>

    <br>
    
    <h3>Kanao Tsuyuri</h3>
    <br>
    <p>When Kanao is first introduced, she is an indecisive and quiet girl due to the abuse she endured in her past before meeting the Kocho sisters. She became unable to make decisions by herself and repressed her emotions as a defense mechanism. In order to help rectify this, Kanae gave her a coin to flip to decide which path to follow when she didn't know what to do.</p>
