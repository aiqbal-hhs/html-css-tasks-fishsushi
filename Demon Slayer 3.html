<h1>Hashira</h1>
    
</div>
    <br>
        <br>
        <p style="color:mistyrose;">Hashira, also known as pillars, are the nine highest ranking demon slayers.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        <h3 style="color:white;">Giyuu Tomioka</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Giyu always wears a serious expression on his face. He has a reserved personality and a strong sense of justice with no tolerance towards those who don't know their own limitations and throw away their lives. Despite letting Nezuko Kamado live due to Tanjiro Kamado's persistence, he shows zero hesitation when killing other Demons and has no respect towards them like most Demon Slayers.</p>

         <h3 style="color:white;">Shinobu Kocho</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Shinobu displays a bright and cheery demeanor, always having a smile on her face regardless of the situation she is in. However, this is shown very quickly to be a facade, shown in the way she enjoys teasing others, to the point of being rather sadistic about it, enjoying most notably to pick on Giyu Tomioka.</p>

    <br>
        
         <h3 style="color:white;">Sanemi Shinazugawa</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Sanemi is abrasive, hot-blooded, and stubborn, often times impulsive and quick to lash out. The only person he displayed reverence towards was Kagaya Ubuyashiki, and only after realizing the man was much more than his outward appearance suggested.</p>

    <br>
        
        
    <h3 style="color:white;">Obanai Iguro</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Obanai is a very harsh and strict individual who shows no concern for those who do not abide by the Demon Slayer conduct. His expectations for his fellow Demon Slayers are nigh-unrealistic, berating Tengen Uzui for suffering heavy wounds against the "weakest" Upper Rank and telling him to "fight to the death" when Tengen insists on retiring. In reality, the Demon Slayer Corps had gone 113 years without killing an Upper Rank, and Shinobu Kocho later estimates that each Upper Rank is equal to three Hashira in strength.</p>

    <br>
        
         <h3 style="color:white;">Mitsuri Kanroji</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Mitsuri is a very emotional and passionate person who constantly compliments people in her head, likely a contributing factor towards her nickname as "the Hashira of Love." Although she is rather shy and is easily flustered, Mitsuri is always kind to others, most notably towards Obanai, whom she appears to share a strong bond with. Given her desperation for marriage, Mitsuri decided to become a member of the Corps with the purpose of finding a suitable husband stronger than her, a rather difficult task given the astounding level of her physical strength. Upon joining the Corps, she felt an immense amount of guilt for her reasoning behind becoming a Demon Slayer to the point where she ate much less than her typical meals. However, she was able to move past those feelings with the help of Shinobu Kocho and Obanai Iguro.</p>

    <br>
        
        <h3 style="color:white;">Muichiro Tokito</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Muichiro is an air-headed individual who seems to constantly wander off in thought and never focus on one thing. Impassive and, at times, obtuse, he tends to think only for himself and operates on logic alone, never letting emotion guide him. Despite this, he has been shown to get serious when it is required and is devoted to his position as the Demon Slayer Corps' Mist Hashira. Alternatively he seems to display a cold and arrogant side; violently shaking down Kotetsu and calling him stupid, saying his time as a Hashira was super important, and that 'all' the sword smiths could do was make weapons.</p>

    <br>
        
        <h3 style="color:white;">Tengen Uzui</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Tengen is a very eccentric person, always wanting to complete actions "flamboyantly." Although he has displayed an uncaring and forceful attitude towards some people—he gets excited imagining how "flamboyant" it would be if Tanjiro Kamado's blood vessels exploded, and tries to forcefully haul Aoi Kanzaki off to the Entertainment District with him so she can unwillingly help him with a dangerous mission—he also has a caring side that is mainly only shown towards his most treasured ones, most notably his three wives, Makio, Suma, and Hinatsuru. He also shows a somewhat nicer side towards Tanjiro after their mission and starts to accept him more as the series goes on.</p>

        <h3 style="color:white;">Kyojuro Rengoku</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">As mentioned in the index, Kyojuro is greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He is amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He is an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age—the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.</p>

    <br>  
        
        
        <h3 style="color:white;">Gyomei Himejima</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color:mistyrose;">Gyomei embodies the gentle giant archetype, being surprisingly soft-spoken and sensitive, despite his intimidating appearance. He is also shown to be quite pious, carrying his prayer beads at all times and offering prayers in poignant situations. Though he maintains a fairly reserved disposition, Gyomei harbors a very objective and somewhat suspicious view of the people around him, owing to his experiences before becoming a Demon Slayer. He is ever-cognizant of what others, particularly children or those younger than him, are capable of if given the opportunity. By reason of his doubtful nature, it can take a while for Gyomei to completely accept and trust others. When he does open up and let others in, he is unwavering in his commitment to them.</p>
